This project was the 2nd capstone for my Thinkful coursework.

The "Capstone_2.ipynb" file is the Jupyter Notebook containing my code for
data exploration, preliminary data analysis, class balancing (or rather,
an attempt since I wanted to retain explanatory power over predictive power), feature engineering,
final model preparation, training and testing of models, hyper-parameter tuning, and final model evaluations.

The other file, "Predicting Video Game Performance", is the slide deck that was used for the presentation.

More work can be done with this project, and it will be further developed and updated here.
